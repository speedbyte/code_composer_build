Linker-generated Copy Tables

================================================================================

The linker now supports extensions to the linker command file (LCF) syntax that

will:



  - make it easier for you to copy objects from load-space to run-space

    at boot-time,



  - make it easier for you to manage memory overlays at run-time, and



  - allow you to split GROUPs and output sections that have separate

    load and run addresses.

1. Previous Approaches to Copy Tables

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1 A Current Boot-Loaded Application Development Process

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



In some embedded applications, there is a need to copy or download code and/or

data from one location to another at boot-time before the application actually

begins its main execution thread.  For example, an application may have its code

and/or data in FLASH memory and need to copy it into on-chip memory before the

application begins execution.



One way to develop an application like this is to create a copy table in

assembly code which contains:



  - the load location (load page id and address),

  - the run location (run page id and address), and

  - the size 

  

of each block of code or data that needs to be moved from FLASH into on-chip

memory at boot-time.



A process for developing such an application might look like this:



  1) Build the application to produce a .map file which contains

     the load and run addresses of each section that has a separate

     load and run placement.



  2) Edit the copy table (used by the boot loader) to correct the load

     and run addresses as well as the sizess of each block of code or

     data that needs to be moved at boot-time.



  3) Build the application again, incorporating the updated copy table.



  4) Run the application.



This process puts a heavy burden on the application developer to maintain the

copy table (by hand, no less).  Each time a piece of code or data is added or

removed from the application, the process must be repeated in order to keep the

contents of the copy table up to date.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.2 An Alternative Approach

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



A developer can avoid some of this maintenance burden by using the LOAD_START(),

RUN_START(), and SIZE() operators that are already part of the LCF syntax

supported by the linker.  For example, instead of having to build the

application to generate a .map file, the linker command file can be annotated:



  SECTIONS

  {

     .flashcode: { app_tasks.obj(.text) } 

         load = FLASH, run = PMEM, 

	 LOAD_START(_flash_code_ld_start),

	 RUN_START(_flash_code_rn_start),

	 SIZE(_flash_code_size)



     ...

  }



The LOAD_START(), RUN_START(), and SIZE() operators will instruct the linker to

create three symbols:



  _flash_code_ld_start	--> load address of .flashcode section

  _flash_code_rn_start	--> run address of .flashcode section

  _flash_code_size	--> size of .flashcode section



These symbols can then be referenced from the copy table.  The actual data in

the copy table will then be updated automatically each time the application is

linked.  This approach removes step 1 of the original process.



While maintenance of the copy table is markedly reduced, the developer must

still carry the burden of keeping the copy table contents in synch with the

symbols that are defined in the linker command file.  Ideally, we'd like to have

the linker generate the boot copy table automatically.  This would avoid having

to build the application twice *and* free the developer from having to

explicitly manage the contents of the boot copy table.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.3 An Overlay Management Example

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Consider an application which contains a memory overlay that must be managed at

run-time.  The memory overlay is defined using a UNION in the linker command

file as follows:



  SECTIONS

  {

     ...



     UNION

     {

        GROUP

	{

	   .task1: { task1.obj(.text) }

	   .task2: { task2.obj(.text) }



	} load = ROM, LOAD_START(_task12_load_start), SIZE(_task12_size)



	GROUP

	{

	   .task3: { task3.obj(.text) }

	   .task4: { task4.obj(.text) }



	} load = ROM, LOAD_START(_task34_load_start), SIZE(_task_34_size)



     } run = RAM, RUN_START(_task_run_start)



     ...

  }



The application must manage the contents of the memory overlay at run-time.

That is, whenever any services from .task1 or .task2 are needed, the application

must first ensure that .task1 and .task2 are resident in the memory overlay.

Similarly for .task3 and .task4.



To effect a copy of .task1 and .task2 from ROM to RAM at run-time, the

application must first gain access to the load address of the tasks

(_task12_load_start), the run address (_task_run_start), and the size

(_task12_size).  Then this information is used to perform the actual code copy.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Generating Copy Tables Automatically with the Linker

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The linker now supports extensions to the LCF syntax to:

  

  - provide the ability to identify any object components that may need

    to be copied from load-space to run-space at some point during the

    run of an application,



  - instruct the linker to automatically generate a copy table that

    contains (at least) the load page id, run page id, load address, 

    run address, and size of the component that needs to be copied, and



  - instruct the linker to generate a user-specified symbol that

    provides the address of a linker generated copy table.

    

For example, the above overlay management example can now be written as follows:

  

  SECTIONS

  {

     ...



     UNION

     {

        GROUP

	{

	   .task1: { task1.obj(.text) }

	   .task2: { task2.obj(.text) }



	} load = ROM, table(_task12_copy_table)



	GROUP

	{

	   .task3: { task3.obj(.text) }

	   .task4: { task4.obj(.text) }



	} load = ROM, table(_task34_copy_table)

     

     } run = RAM



     ...

  }

  

Using the above SECTIONS directive in the linker command file, the linker will

generate two copy tables, _task12_copy_table and _task34_copy_table.  Each copy

table provides the load page id, run page id, load address, run address, and

size of the GROUP that it is associated with.  This information is accessible

from application source code using the linker generated symbols,

_task12_copy_table and _task34_copy_table, which provide the addresses of the

two copy tables, respectively.



Using this method, the developer does not have to worry about creation or

maintenance of a copy table.  The developer can reference the address of any

copy table generated by the linker in C/C++ or assembly source code, passing

that value to a general purpose copy routine which will prcess the copy table

and effect the actual copy.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1 table() Operator

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The mechanism that instructs the linker to produce a copy table is the table()

operator.  A table() operator can be applied to an output section, a GROUP, or a

UNION member.  The copy table generated for a particular table() specification

can be accessed via a user-specified symbol that is provided as an argument to

the table() operator.  The linker will create a symbol with this name and assign

the address of the copy table as the value of the symbol.  The copy table can

then be accessed from the application using the linker generated symbol.

  

Each table() specification applied to members of a given UNION must contain a

unique name.  If a table() oeprator is applied to a GROUP, then none of that

GROUP's members may be marked with a table() specification.  The linker will

detect violations of these rules and report them as warnings, ignoring each

offending use of the table() specification (the linker will not generate a copy

table for erroneous table() operator specifications).



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2 Boot-Time Copy Tables

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The linker supports a special copy table name, BINIT (or binit), that can be

used to create a boot-time copy table.  For example, the linker command file for

the boot-loaded application described earlier ...



  SECTIONS

  {

     .flashcode: { app_tasks.obj(.text) } 

         load = FLASH, run = PMEM, 

	 LOAD_START(_flash_code_ld_start),

	 RUN_START(_flash_code_rn_start),

	 SIZE(_flash_code_size)



     ...

  }



can be re-written as follows:



  SECTIONS

  {

     .flashcode: { app_tasks.obj(.text) } 

         load = FLASH, run = PMEM, 

	 table(BINIT)

     ...

  }



The linker will create a copy table that can be accessed via a special

linker-generated symbol, ___binit__, which contains the list of all object

components that need to be copied from their load location to their run location

at boot-time.  If a linker command file does not contain any uses of

table(BINIT), then the ___binit__ symbol will be given a value of -1 to indicate

that a boot-time copy table does not exist for a particular application.



The table(BINIT) specification can be applied to an output section, GROUP, or

UNION member.  If used in the context of a UNION, only one member of the UNION

can be designated with table(BINIT).  If applied to a GROUP, then none of that

GROUP's members may be marked with table(BINIT).  The linker will detect

violations of these rules and report them as warnings, ignoring each offending

use of the table(BINIT) specification.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3 Applying a table() Operator to Multiple Object Components and Applying 

    Multiple table() Operators to a Single Object Component

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



If you have several pieces of code that need to be managed together, then you

can apply the same table() operator to several different object components.  In

fact, if you want to manage a particular object component in multiple ways, you

can apply more than one table() operator to it.  Consider the following linker

command file excerpt:



  SECTIONS

  {

     UNION

     {

        .first: { a1.obj(.text), b1.obj(.text), c1.obj(.text) }

	       load = EMEM, run = PMEM, table(BINIT), table(_first_ctbl)



        .second: { a2.obj(.text), b2.obj(.text) }

	       load = EMEM, run = PMEM, table(_second_ctbl)

     }



     .extra: load = EMEM, run = PMEM, table(BINIT)



     ...

  }



In this example, the output sections .first and .extra will get copied from

external memory (EMEM) into program memory (PMEM) at boot-time while processing

the BINIT copy table.  After the application has started executing its main

thread, it can then manage the contents of the overlay using the two overlay

copy tables, _first_ctbl and _second_ctbl.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.4 Copy Table Contents

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



In order to use a copy table that is generated by the linker, you must be aware

of the contents of the copy table.  This information is included in a new RTS

header file, cpy_tbl.h, which contains a C source representation of the copy

table data structure that is automatically generated by the linker.



This is a listing of the TMS470 version of cpy_tbl.h:





/*****************************************************************************/

/* cpy_tbl.h  v4.1.2                                                         */

/* Copyright (c) 2005 Texas Instruments Incorporated                         */

/*                                                                           */

/* Specification of copy table data structures which can be automatically    */

/* generated by the linker (using the table() operator in the LCF).          */

/*                                                                           */

/*****************************************************************************/



/*****************************************************************************/

/* Copy Record Data Structure                                                */

/*****************************************************************************/

typedef struct copy_record

{

   unsigned int load_addr;

   unsigned int run_addr;

   unsigned int size;

} COPY_RECORD;



/*****************************************************************************/

/* Copy Table Data Structure                                                 */

/*****************************************************************************/

typedef struct copy_table

{

   unsigned short rec_size;

   unsigned short num_recs;

   COPY_RECORD    recs[1];

} COPY_TABLE;



/*****************************************************************************/

/* Prototype for general purpose copy routine.                               */

/*****************************************************************************/

extern void copy_in(COPY_TABLE *tp);





For each object component that is marked for a copy, the linker will create a

COPY_RECORD object for it.  Each COPY_RECORD contains at least the following

information:



  - component's load page id

  - component's run page id

  - component's load address

  - component's run address

  - component's size



The load page id and the load address are combined in the 'load_loc' field of

the COPY_RECORD.  Likewise, the run page id and the run address are combined in

the 'run_loc' field of the COPY_RECORD.  In both cases, the page id is encoded

in the most significant 8 bits of the 'load_loc' and 'run_loc' fields.  The

actual load/run address is encoded in the least significant 3 bytes of the

'load_loc' and 'run_loc' fields.  A page id of 0 indicates that the address

represented refers to a location in normal TMS470 memory.  A non-zero page id

indicates that the address represented refers to a location in I/O memory.



The linker collects all COPY_RECORDs that are associated with the same copy

table into a COPY_TABLE object.  The COPY_TABLE object will contain the size of

a given COPY_RECORD, the number of COPY_RECORDs in the table, and the array of

COPY_RECORDs in the table.  For example, in the BINIT example above, the .first

and .extra output sections will each have their own COPY_RECORD entries in the

BINIT copy table.  The BINIT copy table will then look something like this:

  

  COPY_TABLE __binit__ = { 12, 2,

                           { <load page id and address of .first>,

                             <run page id and address of .first>,

			     <size of .first> },

                           { <load page id and address of .extra>,

                             <run page id and address of .extra>,

			     <size of .extra> } };



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.5 General Purpose Copy Routine

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The cpy_tbl.h file listed above also contains a prototype for a general purpose

copy routine, copy_in(), which is now provided as part of the runtime support

library.  copy_in() takes a single argument, the address of a linker generated

copy table.  The routine will then process the copy table data object and

perform the copy of each object component specified in the copy table.

  

The copy_in() function definition is provided in a new RTS source file

called cpy_tbl.c.  Here is a listing of the file:

  



/*****************************************************************************/

/* cpy_tbl.c  v4.1.2                                                         */

/* Copyright (c) 2005 Texas Instruments Incorporated                         */

/*                                                                           */

/* General purpose copy routine.  Given the address of a linker-generated    */

/* COPY_TABLE data structure, effect the copy of all object components       */

/* that are designated for copy via the corresponding LCF table() operator.  */

/*                                                                           */

/*****************************************************************************/

#include <cpy_tbl.h>

#include <string.h>



/*****************************************************************************/

/* COPY_IN()                                                                 */

/*****************************************************************************/

void copy_in(COPY_TABLE *tp)

{

   unsigned short i;



   for (i = 0; i < tp->num_recs; i++)

   {

      COPY_RECORD crp = tp->recs[i];

      unsigned char *ld_addr = (unsigned char *)crp.load_addr;

      unsigned char *rn_addr = (unsigned char *)crp.run_addr;

      memcpy(rn_addr, ld_addr, crp.size);

   } 

}



  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Linker Generated Copy Table Sections and Symbols

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The linker will create and allocate a separate input section for each copy table

that it generates.  Each copy table symbol will be defined with the address

value of the input section that contains the corresponding copy table.



Each overlay copy table input section will get a unique linker generated name.

For example, table(_first_ctbl) would place the copy table for the .first

section into an input section called ".ovly:_first_ctbl".  The linker will

create a single input section, .binit, to contain the entire boot-time copy

table.

  

You can control the placement of the linker generated copy table sections using

the input section names in the linker command file.  For example, in this linker

command file ...

  

  SECTIONS

  {

     UNION

     {

        .first: { a1.obj(.text), b1.obj(.text), c1.obj(.text) }

	       load = EMEM, run = PMEM, table(BINIT), table(_first_ctbl)



        .second: { a2.obj(.text), b2.obj(.text) }

	       load = EMEM, run = PMEM, table(_second_ctbl)

     }



     .extra: load = EMEM, run = PMEM, table(BINIT)



     ...



     .ovly: { } > BMEM

     .binit: { } > BMEM

  }

  

the boot-time copy table will get generated into a .binit input section, which

is then collected into the .binit output section, which is then mapped to an

address in the BMEM memory area.  The _first_ctbl will be generated into the

.ovly:_first_ctbl input section and the _second_ctbl will be generated into the

.ovly:_second_ctbl input section.  Since the base names of both of these input

sections match the name of the .ovly output section, both of them will get

collected into the .ovly output section, which is then mapped to an address in

the BMEM memory area.



If no explicit placement instructions are provided for the linker generated copy

table sections, they will be allocated according to the linker's default

placement algorithm.



The linker does not allow other types of input sections to be combined with a

copy table input section in the same output section.  The linker will also not

allow a copy table section that was created from a partial link session to be

used as input to a succeeding link session.

 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Splitting Object Components and Overlay Management

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



In previous versions of the linker, splitting of sections that have separate

load and run placement instructions was not permitted.  The reason for this

restriction was because there was no effective mechanism for the developer to

gain access to the load location or run location of each one of the pieces of

the split object component.  Therefore, there was no effective way to write a

copy routine that could move the split section from its load location to its run

location.



However, the linker does have access to both the load location and run location

of every piece of a split object component.  Using the table() operator, you can

tell the linker to generate this information into a copy table.  Each piece of

the split object component will get its own COPY_RECORD entry in the copy table

object.



For example, consider an application which has 7 tasks.  Task 1 through 3 are

overlaid with tasks 4 through 7 (using a UNION directive).  The load placement

of all of the tasks is split among 4 different memory areas (LMEM1, LMEM2,

LMEM3, and LMEM4).  The overlay is defined as part of memory area PMEM.  Each

set of tasks must be moved into the overlay at run-time before any services from

the set are used.

  

You can now use table() operators in combination with splitting operators, '>>',

to create copy tables that have all the information needed to move either group

of tasks into the memory overlay:

  

  SECTIONS

  {

     UNION

     {

	.task1to3: { *(.task1), *(.task2), *(.task3) } 

		load >> LMEM1 | LMEM2 | LMEM4, table(_task13_ctbl)



	GROUP

	{

	   .task4: { *(.task4) }

	   .task5: { *(.task5) }

	   .task6: { *(.task6) }

	   .task7: { *(.task7) }



	} load >> LMEM1 | LMEM3 | LMEM4, table(_task47_ctbl)



     } run = PMEM



     ...



     .ovly:	> LMEM4



  }



You then might write the driver for such an application as follows:



  #include <cpy_tbl.h>



  extern COPY_TABLE task13_ctbl;

  extern COPY_TABLE task47_ctbl;



  extern void task1(void);

  ...

  extern void task7(void);



  main()

  {

     ...

     copy_in(&task13_ctbl);

     task1();

     task2();

     task3();

     ...



     copy_in(&task47_ctbl);

     task4();

     task5();

     task6();

     task7();

     ...

  }

  

The contents of the .task1to3 will be split in its load space and contiguous in

its run space.  The copy table, _task13_ctbl, that is generated by the linker

will contain a separate COPY_RECORD for each piece of the split section,

.task1to3.  When the address of _task13_ctbl is passed to copy_in(), each piece

of .task1to3 is then copied from its load location into the run location.



The contents of the GROUP containing tasks 4 through 7 are also split in its

load space.  The linker performs the GROUP split by applying the split operator

to each member of the GROUP in order.  The copy table for the GROUP will then

contain a COPY_RECORD entry for every piece of every member of the GROUP.  These

pieces will all be copied into the memory overlay when the _task47_ctbl is

processed by copy_in().



The split operator can now be applied to an output section, GROUP, or the load

placement of a UNION or UNION member.  The linker will not permit a split

operator to be applied to the run placement of a UNION or the run placement of a

UNION member.  The linker will detect such violations, emit a warning, and

ignore the offending split operator usage.
